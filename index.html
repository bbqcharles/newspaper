    <P> <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/175/charles-oliveira">Charles Oliveria</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4890/arman-tsarukyan">Arman Tsarukyan</a> are putting it all on the line at one of the year's biggest shows.
    </P>
    
    <p>UFC CEO <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/danawhite/status/1744222146673750018">announced</a> Sunday that Oliveira faces Tsarukyan in a lightweight bout at UFC 300 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. He added that the winner of the April 13 bout will become the No. 1 contender for champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3279/islam-makhachev">Islam Makhachev</a>, who White expects to return in the summer after recovering from an injury.</p>

    <p>Oliveira was originally set to fight Makhachev at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1404/ufc-294">UFC 294</a> this past October, but a last-minute cut suffered in training forced him out of that main event spot (he was subsequently replaced by featherweight champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4234/alexander-volkanovski">Alexander Volkanovski</a>, who lost to Makhachev via first-round knockout). “Do Bronx” first fought Makhachev at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1330/ufc-280">UFC 280</a> for a vacant lightweight title, which Makhachev won by submitting Oliveira in the second round.</p>

    <p>
      In his most recent outing this past June, Oliveira scored a first-round TKO win over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2674/beneil-dariush">Beneil Dariush</a> to earn a second crack at Makhachev. Now the former champion has to overcome an elite contender to regain that rematch opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tsarukyan seeks his own rematch with Makhachev after losing a hard-fought decision to the current champion in his debut five years ago. Since that encounter, Tsarukyan has won eight of his past nine fights, including finishes of Dariush, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3338/joaquim-silva">Joaquim Silva</a>, and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4813/joel-alvarez">Joel Alvarez</a>.
    </p>

    <P>UFC 300 is still yet to have an official headliner, with <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3464/jiri-prochazka">Jiri Prochazka</a> vs. <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4120/aleksandar-rakic">Aleksandar Rakic</a>, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4139/calvin-kattar">Calvin Kattar</a> vs. <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1528/aljamain-sterling">Aljamain Sterling</a>, and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5988/bo-nickal">Bo Nickal</a> vs. <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5440/cody-brundage"></a> <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5440/cody-brundage">Cody Brundage</a> currently advertised for the event.</P>
